# XS13 Cyber Security Program

## Overview
XS13 is a comprehensive cyber security program designed to provide a robust command-line interface (CLI) application with additional components written in C++, C, and Assembly. The program focuses on data collection, manipulation, and integration with the Discord API, ensuring high complexity and security through HTTPS and API functionality.
